## üßÆ Risk Calculation Algorithm

### Weighted Scoring System
```
Total Risk Score = (Birdstrike √ó 0.4) + (Weather √ó 0.35) + (Traffic √ó 0.15) + (Historical √ó 0.1)

Risk Levels:
‚Ä¢ High Risk: Score ‚â• 0.7 (Immediate attention required)
‚Ä¢ Medium Risk: 0.4 ‚â§ Score < 0.7 (Caution advised)  
‚Ä¢ Low Risk: Score < 0.4 (Normal operations)
```

### Weight Rationale
- **Birdstrike (40%)**: Primary safety concern with immediate impact potential
- **Weather (35%)**: Critical operational factor affecting visibility and aircraft performance
- **Traffic (15%)**: Congestion increases collision risk and operational complexity
- **Historical (10%)**: Long-term patterns provide context but shouldn't override current conditions

### Risk Determination Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather real-time weather, birdstrike data, traffic patterns
2. **Score Conversion**: Convert qualitative risk levels to numerical scores (0.0-1.0)
3. **Weighted Calculation**: Apply weights to each factor
4. **Final Assessment**: Determine risk level based on total score
5. **Confidence Metrics**: Calculate reliability indicators for predictions

## üåê API Integration & External Services

### OpenWeatherMap API Integration
- **Purpose**: Real-time weather data (temperature, wind speed, visibility, conditions)
- **Caching**: 10-minute cache to reduce API calls and costs
- **Fallback**: Predefined reasonable weather conditions for major airports
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with proper logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in retry mechanisms with RestTemplate

### Birdstrike Data APIs
- **Real-time Integration**: Configurable API endpoints for live birdstrike data
- **Fallback Strategy**: CSV-based historical data when APIs are unavailable
- **Data Processing**: Altitude and incident count analysis
- **Refresh Mechanism**: Scheduled updates every 5 minutes

### Internal REST APIs (8 Endpoints)
1. **POST /api/predict/{airport}** - Core risk prediction
2. **GET /api/predictions** - Prediction history
3. **GET /api/statistics** - Risk distribution metrics
4. **GET /api/airports** - Airport management
5. **GET /api/health** - System health checks
6. **DELETE /api/predictions** - Clear prediction history
7. **GET /api/history/{airport}** - Airport-specific history
8. **POST /api/airports** - Add new airports

-- Airports table (94 international airports)
CREATE TABLE airports (
    id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    country VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
