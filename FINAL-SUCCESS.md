## 🚀 **HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM**

### **Option 1: Current Functional Setup**
Both systems are already running:
1. **Backend**: http://localhost:8080 (API + Static pages)
2. **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 (React app)

### **Option 2: Restart Everything**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd frontend
npm start
```

### **Option 3: Automated Script**
```bash
./run-react-app.sh
```

## 📊 **ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Technology Stack**
```
Frontend: React 18 + JavaScript/TypeScript
    ↓ HTTP Requests (JSON)
Backend: Spring Boot 2.7.18 + REST API
    ↓ JPA/JDBC
Database: H2 In-Memory + CSV Data
    ↓ External APIs
Services: OpenWeatherMap + Risk Calculation
```

### **Data Flow**
```
User Input → React UI → REST API → Spring Boot → Risk Engine → Database
     ↑                                                           ↓
Response ← JSON Data ← HTTP Response ← Service Layer ← Data Storage
```
